# Dirsec.net Reborn
Welcome to the new github repository for Dirsec.net. This is the next iteration of our Team Fortress 2 site, with better and improved features such as a map repositories and better search engine optimization. This time, I aim to make the github repository the center of our future development - therefore it is essential for us to make sure there is good documentation and to report all issues to the issue tracker.
